### Foundational Computational and Data Skills for Researchers and Librarians

As data gets bigger and more and more research requires computation, your researchers and librarians need new skills. 
Many would like to work more efficiently, but don't know how. No pathway exists to help many graduate students and postdocs 
learn crucial computational and data science skills.

### This is a problem Software, Data and Library Carpentry can fix.

We teach researchers and librarians foundational computing and data skills. We also help build local communities of practice around tools and disciplines.

### Why is that important?

Learning new skills is one thing. Embedding them is another.  It takes a supportive community to help people integrate new skills and make them part of daily practice.

### How do we help?

1. Software, Data and Library Carpentry partner with institutions to build researcher and librarian capacity within your organisation. 
2. We run two-day workshops that introduce coding and coding best practice to researchers/librarians and teach them the basics of data science. 
3. We train new instructors for you so you get more workshops taught. 
4. We continue mentoring those instructors, who, with their learners, become the core of new communities around disciplines and tools.

### Benefits for your institution

- Your research training dollars are not wasted on workshops with poor ROI
- Research productivity is enhanced, leading to faster, more reliable results
- Researchers and librarians are taught the basics of reproducible science
- You help create and foster the research/librarian workforce you need
- Offering students training aids recruitment and enhances graduate outcomes
- Our instructor training program builds great teachers

### Who we are

The Carpentries is a non-profit volunteer organization that teaches essential computing and data skills. 
We exist because the skills needed to do computational, data-intensive research are not offered as basic research 
training in most universities or disciplines.

### Software, Data and Library Carpentry offer

- Open source, community-developed lessons
- Workshops based on a learn-by-doing, ‘code with me’ approach
- A supportive learning culture
- Instructor training, mentoring and support
- Active global community which subscribes to an inclusive code of conduct
- Evidence-based, proven pedagogical training metho
