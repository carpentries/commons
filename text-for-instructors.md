### Text for Instructors

Software, Data, and Library Carpentry (The Carpentries) are programs of The Carpentries (an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation).  The Carpentries Instructors are volunteers who teach foundational 
computational and data skills to researchers, e.g., programming basics in R and Python, use of the command line, 
and version control. Housed on GitHub, all Carpentriesâ€™ lessons are open source, with an open contribution model, 
and lessons are collaboratively created and maintained by volunteers. Lessons are taught by Instructors in two-day workshops.

I have volunteered as a [Software|Data|Library] Carpentry Instructor for YYY years. Being a Carpentries' Instructor has
sharpened my skills in the following ways. I have

- developed my teaching abilities, both through the Instructor training course I attended to certify as an Instructor and through regular teaching `[perhaps list # workshops taught]`
- gained greater insight into and knowledge of the tools taught at workshops (git, Unix shell, Python and R)
- managed interpersonal interactions with a wide range of learners from all backgrounds
- gained useful perspectives and adaptability through teaching audiences with different levels of skill 
- developed research and teaching insights by instructing learners in disciplines other than my own
- volunteered my time to help teach others [computing|data|information] skills because I believe in the importance of these skills to foster research
- learned better time management to stay on top of all my commitments
- deepened my understanding of equity and inclusion principles through [Software|Data|Library] Carpentry's ethos and Code of Conduct.
