### Text for Instructors

Software and Data Carpentry (The Carpentries) are volunteer organisations whose members teach foundational computational and
data skills to researchers, e.g., programming basics in R and Python, use of the command line, and version control.
Housed on GitHub, all Carpentries’ lessons are open source, with an open contribution model, and lessons are
collaboratively created and maintained by volunteers. Lessons are taught by instructors in two-day workshops.

I have volunteered as a [Software|Data] Carpentry instructor for YYY years. Being a Carpentries' instructor has sharpened my
skills in the following ways. I have

- developed my teaching abilities, both through the instructor training course I attended to certify as an instructor and through regular teaching `[perhaps list # workshops taught]`
- gained greater insight into and knowledge of the tools taught at workshops (git, Unix shell, Python and R)
- managed interpersonal interactions with a wide range of learners from all backgrounds
- gained useful perspectives and adaptability through teaching audiences with different levels of skill
- developed research and teaching insights by instructing learners in disciplines other than my own
- volunteered my time to help teach others [computing|data] skills because I believe in the importance of these skills to foster research
- learned better time management to stay on top of all my commitments
- deepened my understanding of equity and inclusion principles through [Software|Data] Carpentry's ethos and Code of Conduct.
