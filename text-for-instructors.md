### Text for Instructors

Software and Data Carpentry (The Carpentries) are volunteer organisations whose members teach foundational computational and 
data skills to researchers, e.g., programming basics in R and Python, use of the command line, and version control. 
Housed on GitHub, all Carpentriesâ€™ lessons are open source, with an open contribution model, and lessons are 
collaboratively created and maintained by volunteers. Lessons are taught by instructors in two-day workshops.

I have volunteered as a [Software|Data] Carpentry instructor for YYY years. Being a Carpentries' instructor has sharpened my 
kills in the following ways. I have

- developed my teaching abilities, both through the instructor training course I attended to certify as an instructor and through regular teaching `[perhaps list # workshops taught]`
- gained greater insight into and knowledge of the tools taught at workshops (git, Unix shell, Python and R)
- managed interpersonal interactions with a wide range of learners from all backgrounds
- gained useful perspectives and adaptability through teaching audiences with different levels of skill 
- developed research and teaching insights by instructing learners in disciplines other than my own
- volunteered my time to help teach others [computing|data] skills because I believe in the importance of these skills to foster research
- learned better time management to stay on top of all my commitments
- deepened my understanding of equity and inclusion principles through [Software|Data] Carpentry's ethos and Code of Conduct.
