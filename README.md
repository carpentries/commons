# commons
Carpentries Commons is a place for the open sharing of reusable material, such as grant text, wording for job or tenure applications, slide decks for conferences, workshop descriptions, promotional copy, and so on. 

Carpentries staff will have write access to add, edit, and upload material here. Other community members will need to fork the repository and submit pull requests. Some shared resources may be outdated. If you have any questions or feedback, please contact us at [community@carpentries.org](mailto:community@carpentries.org).

Please use this repository to share Carpentries-related material you have created that may be useful to others.
