### Text for Trainers

The Carpentries (Software, Data and Library Carpentry) is a volunteer organisation whose members teach foundational computational 
and data skills to researchers and people working in library- and information-related roles, e.g., programming basics in R and Python, use of the command line, and version control. 
Housed on GitHub, all Carpentriesâ€™ lessons are open source, with an open contribution model, and lessons are collaboratively 
created and maintained by volunteers.

I have volunteered as a [Software|Data|Library] Carpentry Trainer for YYY years.Trainers prepare people to teach as [Software|Data|Library] 
Carpentry instructors. Rather than focus on workshop content, the Carpentries' instructor training curriculum teaches 
evidence-based methods that underpin successful pedagogy. It educates instructors on ways to create and foster a supportive 
and inclusive workshop environment. Being a Carpentries' Trainer has sharpened my skills in the following ways. I have

- developed my teaching capabilities, both through the course I attended to certify as a Trainer and through regular practice since `[perhaps list # workshops taught]`
- gained greater insight into and knowledge of proven, evidence-based, teaching best practice
- managed interpersonal interactions with a wide range of learners from varying backgrounds
- gained useful perspectives and adaptability through teaching learners with different levels of knowledge and skill
- developed research and teaching insights by instructing learners from a range of disciplines 
- volunteered my time to help teach others because I believe in the importance of these skills to foster research
- learned better time management to stay on top of all my commitments
- deepened my understanding of equity and inclusion principles through [Software|Data|Library] Carpentry's ethos and Code of Conduct.
